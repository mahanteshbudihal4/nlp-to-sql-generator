# nlp-to-sql-generator
An NLP to SQL Query Generator built from scratch using a Seq2Seq LSTM model in PyTorch. The system converts natural language queries into SQL statements and executes them on an SQLite database. It supports schema-aware input, handles unseen words, and demonstrates core NLP concepts without using pretrained models.
